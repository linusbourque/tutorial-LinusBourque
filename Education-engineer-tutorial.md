<h1>Deploy Applications with Kind</h1>

Creating containers for application development is a fairly easy task but when you need to create 1000s or more, something more robust is needed. That’s where Kubernetes (or sometimes referred to as K8s) comes in. Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform that is used by many organizations to deploy applications. But if you’re just starting, deploying 1000s of containers may be overkill. Maybe you just need 2-3 for a simple web application. You could still manage these manually individually. Or you can use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to gain practice with kubernetes on our local systems. Let's deploy an application with kind to see how it works. Start by installing kind from https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/.
